# Predicting the Maximum Temperature on a Given Day

This team consists of <a href="https://github.com/DSS3113">Danish Singh Sethi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sohyunp3">Sohyun Park</a><p>

Our advisor for this project was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancy-rausch-velo1/">Ms Nancy Rausch</a>.<p>
  
The goal of this project was to use machine learning to predict the maximum temperature on a given day. Our team used Python implementations of Exponential Smoothing and Linear Regression for this task. We used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction">this dataset</a> on Kaggle, which contains the daily weather conditions of Seattle from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015.<p>

The authors of the implementation of the algorithms are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><b>Danish</b>: Linear Regression</li>
  <li><b>Sohyun</b>: Exponential Smoothing</li>
</ul>

We observed that our Linear Regression performed better than the Exponential Smoothing model with a mean squared error of 4.428.
